This project aimed to reposition Goalpara, one of long-standing tea brands in Indonesia, which was in a tight competition with other modern tea brands. Goalpara itself was well-known among older people because of the conservative tea drinking culture in Indonesia. However, Goalpara was struggling to reintroduce their product to young Indonesians. Most of these young people were aware of foreign brands and were consistently looking to experience new things.</p><p>As suggested in this class, a few short visual observations were performed by gathering images and photos from Google and actual places that could represent the new target market of Goalpara. This process also included demographic studies, brand comprehension, and visual concepts which would be the guides to what the visuals (posters) looked like.</p><p>In conclusion, there were three main hypotheses that might be intriguing to the new market, as follows:</p><ul><li>Drinking tea regularly could help maintain a healthy heartbeat.</li><li>Its antioxidant really helps to lighten the heart's work load and prolong its life span.</li><li>Most people still thought drinking tea would keep them healthy and in good shape.</li></ul><br/><p>Visual execution was done by employing hand sketches and Photoshop for visual manipulations.</p></article></div><div class="l-excerpt-role"><div class="qList"><span class="qList--title">Roles</span><ul class="qList--list"><li>Performing market research</li><li>Identifying SWOT and brand comprehension</li><li>Visual executor</li></ul></div><div class="qList"><span class="qList--title">Tools</span><ul class="qList--list"><li>Photoshop</li><li>Pencil and paper</li><li>Google search</li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="wrapper-12 l-vcd-in"><div class="l-portoIn"><div class="l-portoIn--block"><img src="/assets/img/porto/visual/goalpara-2.jpg" alt="{{page.alt}}" class="l-portoIn--img-DB"/><img src="/assets/img/porto/visual/goalpara-3.jpg" alt="{{page.alt}}" class="l-portoIn--img-DB"/></div></div></div>
